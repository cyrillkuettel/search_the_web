# Advanced Web Search.  
## This is an attempt to program an advanced web search.  

The initial idea was to search multiple Web Pages (like wikipedia, quora.com etc) for specific Keywords. 

Everything under the hood, like http requests, is running in python. The "googlesearch" library was very useful.

My first Idea was write a python-only program with a gui in the module Tkinter. A Monolithic application, everythin in one place. 
I have tried  Tkinter. Now I know to stay away from Tkinter. 
The GUI was made in Visual Studio, because that's just the easy way.
