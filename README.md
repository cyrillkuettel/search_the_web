# Advanced Web Search.  
 
The idea for this project was apply the "site:" command in google search to multiple websites at once.
The goal was to increase efficiency. 
The backend is written in python. For this I have used the "googlesearch" package.


## Why the Gui is a Windows Forms Application?
My first Idea was write a python script using Tkinter.
I have experimented with Tkinter. After the initial shock, I have decided against using it. 
The GUI, then, was created in Windows Froms Designer. In retrospect, a better idea might have been to use soething like PyQt.

## TODO: 
 - Increase the depth of search.
 For Example:
 For each search result:
      -create tree of all Links, which flow outward from it.
