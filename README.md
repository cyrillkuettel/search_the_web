# Advanced Web Search.  
 
The initial idea I had, was to search multiple Web Pages at once. The goal was to increase efficiency. 
The "backend" is written in python. The "googlesearch" library was very useful.

TODO: 
 -Increase the depth of search. 
 For Example:
 For each search result:
      -create tree of all Links, which flow outward from it.

## Why the Gui is a Windows Forms Application?
My first Idea was write a python script using Tkinter. A "monolithic" application, everything in one file. 
I have experimented with Tkinter. (Now I know to stay away from Tkinter. )
The GUI, then, was created in Windows Froms Designer. The reason for that choice is just familiarity and convenience. I could also have used a python GUI Framework.
